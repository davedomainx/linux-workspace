Issue with spacewalk after yum -y update.
spacewalk has alot of components/moving parts (foreman has even more but I
digress).

Had a closer look at spacewalk...

Spacewalk is (was) the upstream for Satellite <= 5, but looks like RedHat
went their own way for Satellite 6.

aha saw web comments that RedHat are ditching Satellite and moving to theforeman ?

=== theforeman ===

Good:
- excellent feel and quality to the overall provisioning lifecycle
- NFS as a media install is busted (?)
- docco overall is good, but there are huge gaps

Bad:
- puppet is not setup at all to run on client by default (?!)
- foreman does not act as a puppetmaster by default (!?)
- NFS as a media install is busted (?)
- cannot write a kickstart file for a specific host, have to do the hostgroup/
environment/operating system route
- docco assumes and leaves out huge knowledge gaps

=== theforeman -> qemu ===

Websocket error when trying to access console of VM from foreman:
  Added daveserver.localdomain to windows hosts file

  I think I clicked through on the striked-out https and then reloaded page,
  that seems to have worked
  er no it was using https://daveserver.localdomain as the URL that worked ..

yum install -y foreman-console
 just one file, is it really doing anything ?

Ah okay I can direct-edit the Bridges in the daveserver.localdomain host

Finally got pxeboot working.. vmlinux and initrd were 0 bytes when copied from
the CentOS ISO ..

Hm I can connect using curl but not browser
  is firewall
  but then get "cannot read client cert from environment"

 had wrong nameserver - dracut shell couldnt resolve daveserver
   didnt fix it ..
   localdomain is the problem ..

== Turn off dnsmasq for the "foreman" bridge

[root@daveserver etc]# grep -v ^# dnsmasq.conf|grep -v ^$
port=5353
interface=virbr0
bind-interfaces
conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d

systemctl restart dnsmasq
systemctl restart libvirtd

confirm dnsmasq only controlling virbr0; nope, still runs on foreman,
cannot easily turn it off, just make dnsmasq do nothing ..

sudo -u puppet /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/node.rb donna-senion.davedomain

Added stringify_facts = false
to puppet.conf template
which is called by puppet_setup

pxeboot BOOTIF=mac_address is correct, but it tries to load a long nonexistent
kickstart file in /var/lib/tftpboot, and doesnt try the correct mac-address file

wget was missing somehow from the install ... I had it commented out for some
dumb reason in my own kickstart template ?

20.June
dhcpd.conf next-server must be the 'gateway machine' in the libvirt subnet ..
192.168.10.1 in this case.  now can pxeboot

still not sure how/where it is attempting to dhcprequest the 192.168.10.117 entry
from.

curl got a dns timeout.  restarted firewall, named
tried pinging donna-senion and daveserver - now it just works (?)

29.June
  setup new "foreman-static" subnet 192.168.11.0/24
  idea is to create naming-service VMs in this subnet with static IPs
  /etc/dnsmasq.conf:
    interface=foreman-static
    dhcp-host=<mac>,<hostname>,<ip>,infinite
    dhcp-range=192.168.11.50,192.168.11.150,static,255.255.255.0,infinite
  I couldnt get pxe working via virsh net-edit foreman-static

  odd results with static/dhcp for namer2.
  think I forgot to manually specify boot mode static
  Subnet options

Subnets are defined in Foreman under Infrastructure > Subnets, and have a few options that affect how hosts are provisioned.

IPAM: DHCP will use a DHCP-enabled smart proxy, checking for assigned leases and reservations and suggesting a new IP from the range. Internal DB will use Foreman’s list of already-assigned IPs and doesn’t rely on a DHCP smart proxy. None disables auto-suggestion of IP addresses.
Boot mode: during OS provisioning, the template will configure the interface with either a static IP address or to use DHCP depending on the value of this setting.

8.July
  foreman/libvirtd got into a state - rebooted host
  rebuilt namer2 -static works now (?)
    Interfaces - Managed - ticked
    Interfaces - IP - 192.168.11.52
    67:28 is NOT in dhcpd.conf, dnsmasq.conf or virsh net-edit foreman-static ...
    it seems the provisioning stage uses a dhcp IP from the dnsmasq.conf range ..

  Problem 1 : was using the wrong operating system for some reason.
    fixed with the right OS.
    All template-resolving is now correct.
  Problem 2 : libvirtd provider was using the general 'foreman' dhcp network
    explictly tell each new VM to use the foreman-static network
  Just add the deisred static-IP to Interfaces : IPv4
    Note although you specify a static IP, it uses a temporary dhcp ip from the range
      maybe need to set static-IP entry in dnsmasq.conf ..
    no need to special-edit dnsmasq.conf or virsh net-edit foreman-static .. just works now
  Note :
    cannot seem to clone a VM - foreman and/or static network doesnt seem to like it
    new machines need to be rebooted twice maybe to get the initial pxe boot working (?)

setup some better defaults with hammer, domain-level
hammer hostgroup list
hammer hostgroup info --id 1
hammer hostgroup set-parameter --hostgroup "Provision from daveserver.davedomain" --name enable-puppetlabs-pc1-repo --value true
