As of June 2017, seems to boil down to this:

foreman vs satellite 6 for provisioning (install a system)
puppet/ansible/chef/salt for configuration (keep the system configured)
terraform vs mcollective for orchestration (run something on the system)

== Provisioners ==

# Install an OS onto a system

Cobbler
Foreman
SaltStack
Satellite
Vagrant (Virtual Machines)

== Cloud Management ==

# Remote Virtual Machines from a Cloud-Service organisation

Amazon Web Services

== Containers ==

# Lightweight abstraction of a system that runs in it's own dedicated
# seperated namespace on a system.

== Configuration Management ==

# Keep systems in a consistent state

Ansible
Cfengine
Chef
Puppet
Salt
Vagrant

== Content Management ==

# Applications, Repositories, patching, errata, security, subscriptions

Spacewalk            ## Community Upstream
 -> Satellite 5      ## RedHat implementation

Satellite 6         ## RedHat upstream, complete standalone from Satellite 5
                    ## Now combines Katello, Foreman, Pulp, candlepin

Katello             ## Content Management.



== Orchestration ==

# Perform tasks on systems

terraform
MCollective

== Virtual Machine ==

# Instance of a system, that runs inside of another system
