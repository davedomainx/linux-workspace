Glacially slow when running windows VMs.
I cheaped out when I specced the server in 2016, need to upgrade.

currently has 2 core 2 processors Intel Celeron G4400T

http://www.cpu-world.com/Sockets/Socket_1151_H4_LGA1151.html

System Information
Manufacturer: Supermicro
Product Name: X11SSL-CF
Serial Number : VM15CS023044

LGA 1151 Socket
this socket was revised with coffee lake processors and introduced with the 300 chipsets.

So any Kaby lake proc should work on the X11SSL-CF
it is coffee lake have to be careful of.

The X11SSL-CF should support all Kaby Lake based CPUâ€™s (like the E3-V6) with BIOS version 2.0+.

xeon e3 1240 looks like sweet spot
1230 v6 looks best

i7-8700 on ark.intel.com has a FCLGA1151 socket, which is apparently the same thing as LGA1151

Hmm seems to be divided into
skylake 100 series chipsets
kaby lake 200 series chipsets
coffee lake 300 series chipsets

z170 vs 236 chipset

do I actually have a 232 or 236 chipset?  232 didnt have virtualisation support ?

bios upgrade worked as expected.
subsequent boots timing out at centos boot
dev-mapper-centos\x2droot.device
not sure if it's finding the SSDs..
it seems to be rebooting during POST

prolly need to turn on sthg in BIOS
SATA - hard drives - the SSDs were set at hard drive (not SSD)

SSDs were not found in the boot disk select screen
hmm if it cant find the ssds how is it booting to centos ? (MBR on the raid1 SSD..)

try power on device ssd in bios SATA.

try cold power on.

then try sata mode raid (was AHCI).

meh it wasnt the boot order was it..
the ssds were in the bios boot select screen but no longer ..

okay the SSDs are now in bios advanced as Intel RSTE raid devices
the 4x hard drives also in bios advanced as LSI SAS

bingo - saw the SSD info screen (ctrl i)
also "intel SSDs" is now a bios boot override option (but not bios boot ..)
think it was these 2:
sata mode selection : RAID
sata raid option option rom/uefi driver : legacy rom

and possibly also:
pci/pce -> onboard sas option rom : legacy

still boot looping ?
