# DNS issues - can't contact domain controller
# win10rsat is a DHCP client and
# Primary DNS suffix is not set to davedomain.org by DHCP 
# should fix this properly but for now:

Rightclick Newtork icon -> Open Network + Internet Settings
Ethernet -> Change Adapter Options -> Intel -> Properties -> TCP/IPv4 -> Properties -> Use following DNS:
<IP of DC1>
8.8.8.8 # secondary

Advanced -> DNS
Select 'append primary and connection specific dns suffixes'
DNS suffix for this connection : davedomain.org
tick 'Register this connection's addreses in DNS'
tick 'use this connection's DNS suffix in DNS'

Powershell
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
ipconfig /all
	# Seems that "Primary DNS Suffix = davedomain.org" MUST be set for domain join to work

Add-Computer -DomainName "davedomain" -Restart ## Reboots automatically if successful

At reboot, can login as DAVEDOMAIN\darnold

# Server Manager
Add Server -> Active Directory -> Domain Controllers -> dc1 #
righclick DC1 -> AD Admin Center -> works now

Manage -> Server Manager Properties
Server manager refresh period (minutes) : 2 # 10 is default, which is too low
