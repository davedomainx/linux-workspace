The Server Core option is a minimal installation option that is 
available when you are deploying the Standard or Datacenter 
edition of Windows Server.  Server Core includes most but not 
all server roles. Server Core has a smaller disk footprint, and 
therefore a smaller attack surface due to a smaller code base.

Server Core does not have a traditional desktop interface. 
Instead, Server Core is designed to be managed remotely through 
the command line, PowerShell, or a GUI tool (like RSAT or Windows 
Admin Center).

Server core is installed on the 2016 server.

If you close all command prompt windows and want to open a new 
Command Prompt window, you can do that from the Task Manager. 
Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, click Start Task Manager, click More 
Details > File > Run, and then type cmd.exe. (Type 
Powershell.exe to open a PowerShell command windows.) 
Alternatively, you can sign out and then sign back in

- or you can send it via the virsh send-keys method - 
virsh send-key ad1 --codeset linux --holdtime 1000 KEY_LEFTCTRL KEY_LEFTALT KEY_DELETE

this also brings up a mini task-manager which could be useful

Winver.exe isn't available in Server Core. To obtain version 
information use Systeminfo.exe

2016 now says : Enter credentials for DAVEDOMAIN\Administrator ..

look at rsat.txt for remote management of the Server Core
