Do I use foreman as a puppet master or stand up a different puppet master ?

Hammer
  horrible horrible PoS ~/.hammer/BS/config was overriding /etc/hammer/config BS BS BS 1 hour wasted
 hammer sc-param update --puppet-class ntp --name servers --parameter-type 'string' --default-value ['server 0.europe.pool.ntp.org']
  hammer sc-param add-override-value --match domain=daveserver --puppet-class ntp --smart-class-parameter servers --value ["server 0.europe.pool.ntp.org"]
 Override value created

 hammer sc-param list --puppet-class firewalld


Also find out for once and for all what the ENC is..


Issue with spacewalk after yum -y update.
spacewalk has alot of components/moving parts (foreman has even more but I
digress).

Had a closer look at spacewalk...

Spacewalk is (was) the upstream for Satellite <= 5, but looks like RedHat
went their own way for Satellite 6.

aha saw web comments that RedHat are ditching Satellite and moving to theforeman ?

=== theforeman ===

Good:
- excellent feel and quality to the overall provisioning lifecycle
- NFS as a media install is busted (?)
- docco overall is good, but there are huge gaps

Bad:
- puppet is not setup at all to run on client by default (?!)
- foreman does not act as a puppetmaster by default (!?)
- NFS as a media install is busted (?)
- cannot write a kickstart file for a specific host, have to do the hostgroup/
environment/operating system route
- docco assumes and leaves out huge knowledge gaps

=== theforeman -> qemu ===

# FIXME : Changed /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf to explictly stop using polkit

Websocket error when trying to access console of VM from foreman:
  Added daveserver.localdomain to windows hosts file
  run insecure https from localhost
  I think I clicked through on the striked-out https and then reloaded page,
  that seems to have worked
  er no it was using https://daveserver.localdomain as the URL that worked ..

 ERF12-6899 [ProxyAPI::ProxyException]: Unable to set DHCP entry ([RestClient::BadRequest]: 400 Bad Request) for proxy

Firewalld blocking VNC console
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=5910-5930/tcp # FIXME : better src restrictions

yum install -y foreman-console
 just one file, is it really doing anything ?

foreman-installer --list-scenarios
ls '/etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/

Ah okay I can direct-edit the Bridges in the daveserver.localdomain host

Finally got pxeboot working.. vmlinux and initrd were 0 bytes when copied from
the CentOS ISO ..
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-users/oguMH7ig7kU

Hm I can connect using curl but not browser
  is firewall
  but then get "cannot read client cert from environment"
[root@daveserver foreman-proxy]# curl -k https://daveserver.localdomain:8443/features
["dhcp","dns","logs","puppet","puppetca","tftp"][root@daveserver foreman-proxy]#
[root@daveserver foreman-proxy]#

failed to fetch kickstart from daveserver.localdomain/unattended
 https://daveserver.davedomain/unattended/provision?spoof=192.168.122.123
 had wrong nameserver - dracut shell couldnt resolve daveserver
   didnt fix it ..
   localdomain is the problem ..
 allow firewalld nfsd ports

firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mountd
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=rpc-bind
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ftp

setup vsftpd

looks like the CA puppet SSL was still set to daveserver.localdomain somehow ..

puppet resource service puppet ensure=stopped
puppet resource service puppetserver ensure=stopped
cd /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/
mv ssl ssl.localdomain
puppet cert list -a --noop

cd ssl/ca

== Turn off dnsmasq for the "foreman" bridge

[root@daveserver etc]# grep -v ^# dnsmasq.conf|grep -v ^$
port=5353
interface=virbr0
bind-interfaces
conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d

systemctl restart dnsmasq
systemctl restart libvirtd

confirm dnsmasq only controlling virbr0; nope, still runs on foreman,
cannot easily turn it off, just make dnsmasq do nothing ..

sudo -u puppet /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/node.rb donna-senion.davedomain

Added stringify_facts = false
to puppet.conf template
which is called by puppet_setup

pxeboot BOOTIF=mac_address is correct, but it tries to load a long nonexistent
kickstart file in /var/lib/tftpboot, and doesnt try the correct mac-address file

wget was missing somehow from the install ... I had it commented out for some
dumb reason in my own kickstart template ?

20.June
dhcpd.conf next-server must be the 'gateway machine' in the libvirt subnet ..
192.168.10.1 in this case.  now can pxeboot

still not sure how/where it is attempting to dhcprequest the 192.168.10.117 entry
from.

curl got a dns timeout.  restarted firewall, named
tried pinging donna-senion and daveserver - now it just works (?)

29.June
  setup new "foreman-static" subnet 192.168.11.0/24
  idea is to create naming-service VMs in this subnet with static IPs
  /etc/dnsmasq.conf:
    interface=foreman-static
    dhcp-host=<mac>,<hostname>,<ip>,infinite
    dhcp-range=192.168.11.50,192.168.11.150,static,255.255.255.0,infinite
  I couldnt get pxe working via virsh net-edit foreman-static
