1) Install AD DC

2) Install a non-domain join Windows10 and use ServerManager to finish it ?

3) Join a Win10 RSAT box to the domain and finsh configuring it ?

===
Seems I cannot directly manage the DC as it is
Windows2016 [ Server Core ] ?

Need to setup a Win10 Enterprise VM with RSAT.  

Starting with Windows 10 October 2018 Update, RSAT 
is included as a set of Features on Demand in Windows 
10 itself.

Run -> winver (will display Windows version)

RSAT can be turned on/off by going:
Search -> Manage Optional Features -> Add a feature -> Select RSAT tool -> Install
(give it a minute to install the page to refresh)

Enable Remote commands on r2016 server

Open powershell on local and 2016 boxes
ensure ping in both directions

1. CLI ?
Enable-PSRemoting -Force

2. Server Manager ?
Configure-SMRemoting.exe –Enable

bit confusing between:

. RSAT (Remote Support Admin Tools)
. Server Manager 
	.. Search -> Server Manager
	... prompted to try Windows Admin Center
. Windows Admin Center
	.. intended to replace MMC (and eventually Server Manager?)
. MMC (Microsoft Management Console)
	.. various snap-ins to manage console 
	.. mmc.exe is NOT installed on Server Core
. RDS (Remote Desktop Services)
	.. can be used to manage the server remotely
	cscript C:\Windows\System32\Scregedit.wsf /ar 0

ServerManager
DC - DNS Manager
Add A entry for win10manager box

====
on manager box Powershell as Administrator

Rename-Computer -NewName CN1 -LocalCredential WS\Administrator -PassThru 
shutdown -r -t 0

tcp/ip settings -> set DNS to the DCs

Open Start > Settings > Accounts > Access work or school 
Click Connect 
Click 'Join this device to a local Active Directory domain' 

Enter the Domain name 
Click Next

reboot
should automatically join domain

You will need to re-add in ServerManager etc
Now AD Admin center works!


==

search -> notepad -> runas Admin -> open
c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts
192.168.122.101 dc1.davedomain.org dc1
192.168.122.102 dc1.davedomain.org dc2

Get-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts
Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value "dc1,dc1.davedomain.org,dc2,dc2.davedomain.org" –Force

ServerManager - Create ServerGroup - DCs
DNS - Search for dc1 - should populate with IP address - Add
DCs - manage as - DAVEDOMAIN.ORG\rootsecdev
	tick remember me

or
Created Admin Account in sconfig
	ServerManager : Connect as : DC1\rootsecdev

	BINGO AD DS now selectable
	ah ffs denied 

	this fixed it
	net user darnold * /add
	net localgroup Administrators /add darnold
	
	In SErver Manager, select server, right click, manage as:
	DC1\darnold
	and can now move on

	after install, probably need to manage as
	DAVEDOMAIN\darnold but not working ?

	it's semi working

rightclick dc1
AD Domains and Trusts

troubleshooting
stood up fresh new DC
VMs can ping gateway, host, themselves.  But not each other (I could ping each other b4)
seems theres a firewall blocking ping


===
virsh list --all ; virsh start <name>
# port number appears to map to order in which vms were bought up
ssh ds -L 5900:127.0.0.1:5900
spicy -h localhost -p 5900 -w <password>
