# didnt work, kernel is protected, 

dload C8 ISO
Attach ISO to 192.168.1.2 - Remote Console - Console Redirection - Plug it in.
F11 - boot - ATEN CD
Install as per normal
Del - show only UEFI devices - move Intel Boot to bottom - Centos 8 to top - save and exit
Boots normally

Install ZFS 0.8.2, no issues, but see /data/backups/dec2019/zpool* for status of the dying HDD .. probably initated by the ZFS scrub I did in mid-Dec 2019

beelink: /etc/systemd/system/home.mount
systemctl restart home.mount

Eir router - changed daveserver static IP maps, 
rebooted daveserver + rebooted beelink - all good

==

brctl (via bridge-utils) is gone
	nmcli -f bridge c s

==

dnf upgrade .. also upgraded the kernel
	on reboot, zfs was gone
	must follow procedure to uninstall and reinstall zfs again

wget http://download.zfsonlinux.org/epel/zfs-release.el8_1.noarch.rpm
dnf remove zfs zfs-kmod spl spl-kmod libzfs2 libnvpair1 libuutil1 libzpool2 zfs-release
dnf install ./zfs-release.el8_1.noarch.rpm
dnf autoremove
dnf clean metadata
dnf install zfs
zfs list
/sbin/modprobe zfs
systemctl restart zfs
systemctl restart zfs-mount
systemctl restart zfs-share
systemctl restart zfs-import-cache
zfs list
systemctl restart home.mount

< allow the following through the firewall : 111, 2049 and mountd (rpcinfo -p) >

should now be able to mount zfs FS via NFS

got sick of firewall-cmd and iptables.
switched to native-nftables.

lets try BIOS upgrade again!

unzip the BIOS file somewhere
cd /data/iso/SuperMicro/sum_2.1.0_Linux_x86_64/
./sum -c UpdateBios --file /data/iso/SuperMicro/X11SSL9_B26/X11SSL9.B26

# required to get the SSDs/controller presenting:
advanced -> sata mode selection : RAID
advanced -> sata raid option option rom/uefi driver : legacy rom
advanced -> sata SSD -> Ensure Hard Disk Type is 'Solid State Drive'
advanced -> sata SSD -> Ensure "Power on SSD" is NOT selected

# required to get the LBI HBA MPT SAS presenting
pci/pce -> onboard sas option rom : legacy

# 1st boot option should be 'Centos' and NOT 'Intel SSDs'
