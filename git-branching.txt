== Rebasing ==

You checked out a branch from master and did some work to it. 
In the meantime a colleague merged to master, changing the master branch.
You now need to "rebase" your branch changes with the updated master branch.

git checkout <branch>
git pull --rebase origin master

== Branching ==

 # Easy create new branch and set remote
 git config --global push.default current
 git checkout -b mynewbranch
 git push -u

# show committed but not pushed
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2016901/viewing-unpushed-git-commits/21391629

git diff origin/master..HEAD 
git log --branches --not --remotes
git log --branches --not --remotes --simplify-by-decoration --decorate --oneline --graph

git remote show origin
git remote -v

git branch blow-it-up
git checkout blow-it-up
.. git checkout -b blow-it-up # one liner for branch+checkout
git add somefile 

< something critical came up, need to go back to master and create a new branch for a quick sec >

git checkout master
git checkout -b critical
do some work
git commit ..
git push -u origin HEAD # git push -u origin HEAD
  # NOTE : -u seems to mess up jenkinsPipeline ..

git checkout master
git merge critical
git branch -d critical # delete it locally
git push origin --delete critical # delete it remotely

== Branching : show differences ==

git log --oneline --graph --decorate --abbrev-commit master..somebranch
git log master..somebranch

git diff master..somebranch
git diff master..aws-provider-upgrade -- prod/dbpg-alto.tf

git difftool -t meld master..somebranch

git config --global diff.tool meld
git config --global --add difftool.prompt false

== Branching : show unmerged ==

git log --all --not master
git branch --no-merged master
git log branch1 --not master --stat

== Cherry ==

git cherry -v master branch1
git log --cherry master branch1

== Merge remote master branch into local branch ==

# Maybe you got lazy and direct-commited into master and now you need to pull
# those changes in master into local branch, with possible conflicts
# -Xtheirs prefers the master branch when resolving conflicts


git checkout mybranch
git merge -Xtheirs origin/master

== Branching : real-life ==

I did the following in context of upgrading a Terraform provider.
I wanted to make a directory to move some files to allow
a terraform init -upgrade to succeed.  Branch+Checkout

git checkout -b aws-provider-upgrade
mkdir original && mv "some_files" original/
terraform init -upgrade # successful ..
git checkout master
 
I expected to be back at the immediate stage prior to running 
"git checkout -b aws-provider-upgrade", eg, no 'original/some_files*'

however the changes I made (mkdir original && mv some_files original) 
in the "aws-provider-upgrade" branch carried through after I switched
back to master ?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29415049/git-feature-branch-changes-being-carried-over-to-master
  Uncomitted changes don't belong to any branch

confirm this by switching the branches:

git checkout aws-provider-upgrade
git checkout master

== Cleanup ==

git fetch --prune
git remote prune origin --dry-run
