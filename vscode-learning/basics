I have vim bindings turned on - works

Doesn't seem to auto-pickup .gitconfig (?)
  git config user.name # looks good
  git config user.email # looks good
  seems to be that user.name wasnt set inside this repo (?)

git config --global --add safe.directory ~/Git/linux-workspace/

Adding repos to a workspace, and then saving that workspace
seems to get the tree-view I like
